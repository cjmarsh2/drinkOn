                Have you ever needed a happy hour RIGHT NOW?<br>
                Wondered what’s on the menu?<br>
                How close it is to you?<br>
                Sick of being told by Yelp and Google that drinks are half off until 7, only to find it’s actually until 6?<br>
                There is a better way...<br>
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                We have come together as a team to create an app where users can find the closest happy hour happening right now. In addition, our app will provide you with a current & updated happy hour drink and food menu.
